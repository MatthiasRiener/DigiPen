            <p class="sub-title">a. Age Restrictions</p>
            <p class="content">To use Google Pay you must be 16 years of age or older. If you are 16 or older but under 18 years of age
                (or the legal age of your country, if greater), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission 
                to use Google Pay and to accept the Terms.</p>

            <p class="sub-title">b. Basic Use Requirements</p>
            <p class="content">To use Google Pay you will need a Google Account; a device that meets the Service’s system and com-
                patibility requirements, which may change from time to time; working Internet access; and compatible
                Software. Your ability to use Google Pay, and Google Pay’s performance, may be affected by these factors.
                Such system requirements are your responsibility.
                </p>

            <p class="sub-title">c. Getting started</p>
            <p class="content">You may set up Google Pay using the Google Pay application on your mobile device, the Google Pay func-
                tionality in your Android device’s settings, or via your Payment Instrument issuer’s app. After you have 
                provided the requested information and attempted to add a Payment Instrument to Google Pay, Google
                 Pay will check both whether your Payment Instrument’s issuer currently supports Google Pay and whether
                 The card itself is eligible to be used with Google Pay. All of a participating issuer’s cards may not be eligible.
                 If your Payment Instrument’s issuer does not currently support Google Pay or your Payment Instrument is 
                not eligible to be added to Google Pay, Google may alert you via email when your Payment Instrument 
                Becomes eligible. If your Payment Instrument’s issuer supports Google Pay and your Payment Instrument is
                eligible, when adding it you will see a screen asking you to accept the issuer’s terms and conditions. Once 
                you have done so and successfully added the Payment Instrument, Google Pay will store a Virtual Account 
                Number representing your payment card’s actual card number, or associate your Transit Pass or Linked-In.
